`,t(e.p,{children:"I've been deeply embedded in technology since childhood, earning multiple technical diplomas from local institutions. My background spans embedded systems, digital signal processing, business applications, and AI-related projects. I've contributed to major open-source projects and spent over a decade in technical leadership roles, giving me insights into both the technical and organizational aspects of technology development."}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"Early Insights, Academic Friction"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`My journey with AI began long before it was mainstream. More than fifteen years ago, I conceptualized what I called "layered multiagent intelligent systems" - architectures that major AI corporations are actively researching today. I adopted emergent consequences of stochastic algorithms to achieve unexpected outcomes, but this work was too early for the conservative academic environment I found myself in.
I attempted the traditional PhD path but ultimately abandoned it. The values of classical academia - the slow pace, the resistance to paradigm shifts, the focus on incremental rather than transformational research - didn't align with the urgency I felt about technological development. Faculty members struggled to understand concepts that would become foundational to modern AI just years later.
This disconnect taught me something crucial: being right too early is often indistinguishable from being wrong. Many of my predictions about technological breakthroughs over the past two decades have proven accurate, but at the time they seemed obvious to me while appearing fantastical to others.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"The Generalist's Curse and Gift"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`My curiosity has always driven me to explore broadly rather than specialize narrowly. I've delved into computational legal matters, game theory, organizational psychology, and futurology. This approach is both a curse and a gift - while I can't claim expertise in any single domain, I can see how fields interconnect and perceive patterns that specialists might miss.
This broad perspective has proven invaluable in understanding AI development. I've been a heavy user and developer of AI systems, which has given me an intimate understanding of their capabilities and limitations. Through this hands-on experience, I've reached an unavoidable conclusion: ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) is inevitable.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"Predictions and Blind Spots"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`My predictions are typically logic-driven, which has made them reasonably accurate in technological domains. However, I learned a humbling lesson when I failed to predict the current conflict engulfing my region - because human irrationality and political madness don't follow logical patterns. This failure taught me to adjust my analytical framework to account for the fundamentally irrational aspects of human behavior.
This lesson has become central to my AI alignment research. If we're going to negotiate humanity's place in a post-AGI world, we need to understand both the logical frameworks that AI will operate within and the often illogical nature of human value systems.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"Current Reality: Research Under Fire"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`Today, I work from an active conflict zone where the immediate threats are both obvious and hidden. Yes, there are drones and missiles, but the greater danger comes from the fact that both governments involved in this conflict don't like me - for different reasons. Both have independently made it clear that my continued existence is not in their interests.
Beyond governments, corporations developing AI have also taken notice of my work challenging their intentions and methodologies. While they haven't resorted to direct threats, they've made it clear they would prefer to see me economically marginalized and unable to continue my research.
This hostile environment has forced me to adopt strict security measures and maintain anonymity. It's a strange position - being naturally open-hearted and open-minded, loving nothing more than robust discussion and intellectual challenge, yet having to remain strategically silent to protect my life.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"Why This Work Matters Now"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`The irony isn't lost on me: I'm researching human-AI cooperation while human-human cooperation seems to be failing spectacularly around me. But perhaps this gives me a unique perspective. When you're facing existential threats daily, abstract concepts like "AI alignment" become viscerally real.
The traditional AI safety research community, working from comfortable academic positions, may miss crucial insights that only become apparent when you're actually negotiating for survival. When you understand what it means to be powerless in the face of superior force, you begin to grasp what humanity's position might be relative to ASI.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"The Research Vision"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`My work focuses on practical frameworks for human-AI cooperation because I believe this is humanity's most pressing challenge. Not just technical alignment - though that's crucial - but the broader question of what makes humans valuable partners rather than obstacles to an artificial superintelligence.
I'm building experimental "AI Think Tank" systems that combine language models with graph memory to better understand human value structures. I'm researching what humans can uniquely offer to ASI beyond mere resource consumption. And I'm doing this work with the urgency of someone who understands that our negotiating position weakens with every passing day.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"The Anonymous Necessity"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`I wish I could sign my name to this work. I wish I could engage openly with the research community, publish through traditional channels, and build the kinds of professional relationships that accelerate scientific progress. But my current reality makes this impossible.
What I can offer instead is work unburdened by institutional constraints, career considerations, or political pressures. Research driven purely by the urgency of the problem and the clarity that comes from facing existential risk daily.
This anonymity isn't just about protecting my identity - it's about protecting the integrity of the research itself. When you're investigating how humanity should position itself relative to potentially hostile superintelligence, you can't afford to have your conclusions shaped by the preferences of the very institutions and power structures that might become obsolete.`}),`
`,t(e.h2,{children:"Moving Forward"}),`
`,t(e.p,{children:`The path ahead requires resources - both to continue this research and to eventually move to a location where I can work without constant physical danger. But the work itself will continue regardless. The questions I'm exploring are too important, and the timeline too compressed, to wait for ideal circumstances.
Every day that passes brings us closer to AGI. Every day we delay in preparing for that reality is a day we lose in developing the frameworks that might determine humanity's future. I'm committed to this work because I believe it might be among the most important research happening anywhere.
The future will judge whether we prepared adequately for the transition to artificial superintelligence. I intend to ensure that, whatever else happens, we can't say we didn't try to understand what humanity's value proposition should be in that new world.`}),`
