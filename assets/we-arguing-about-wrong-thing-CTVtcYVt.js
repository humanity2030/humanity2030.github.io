`,t(e.p,{children:["On the other side, you have theories suggesting consciousness requires something beyond classical computation. Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff's ",t(e.a,{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction",rel:"nofollow",children:"Orchestrated Objective Reduction"})," (Orch-OR) theory is one prominent example—they propose consciousness emerges from quantum processes in neural microtubules, something classical computers supposedly can't replicate.
