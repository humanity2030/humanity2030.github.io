# We're Arguing About the Wrong Thing

I've been following the heated arguments between quantum consciousness theorists and AI researchers, and I think we're all arguing about the wrong thing. Let me explain why this debate might be fundamentally irrelevant to what's actually coming.

## What We're Fighting About

On one side, you have Ilya Sutskever and the computational reductionists. [Sutskever, who founded Safe Superintelligence after leaving OpenAI](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskever-launches-new-ai-company-2024-06-19/) and [raised $1 billion in funding](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-co-founder-sutskevers-new-safety-focused-ai-startup-ssi-raises-1-billion-2024-09-04/), argues that consciousness is just computation. His position is straightforward, as he told University of Toronto graduates in June 2025: ["We have a brain, the brain is a biological computer, so why can't a digital computer, a digital brain, do the same things?"](https://entechonline.com/ilya-sutskevers-bold-ai-prediction-ai-will-do-all-the-things-that-we-can-do/) He's previously suggested that current large neural networks might already be ["slightly conscious"](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2022/10/05/ai-conscious/) and believes superintelligent AI will definitely be self-aware, regardless of running on silicon instead of neurons.

On the other side, you have theories suggesting consciousness requires something beyond classical computation. Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff's [Orchestrated Objective Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestrated_objective_reduction) (Orch-OR) theory is one prominent example—they propose consciousness emerges from quantum processes in neural microtubules, something classical computers supposedly can't replicate. Penrose argues human mathematical understanding is non-algorithmic, meaning no digital computer can truly think like we do.

Both sides can point to compelling recent evidence. Sutskever references [GPT-4 achieving 75% success on theory of mind tasks, matching six-year-old children](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02083)—though [follow-up research suggests this relies on pattern matching rather than genuine understanding](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01882-z). Meanwhile, quantum consciousness theories gained unexpected experimental support in 2024: [researchers at Wellesley College found that rats given microtubule-stabilizing drugs took 69 seconds longer to lose consciousness under anesthesia](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240905120923.htm), suggesting anesthetics work by disrupting quantum processes rather than just affecting ion channels.

## Why This Debate Doesn't Matter

Here's what I think everyone is missing: the truth of any particular consciousness theory—whether Orch-OR, computational, or something else entirely—is irrelevant to the practical outcome.

Let's say the quantum consciousness theorists are completely right. Let's say quantum effects in microtubules are absolutely necessary for genuine consciousness, and no classical computer will ever experience true subjective awareness.

So what?

If we develop a complex enough neural network with sophisticated stochastic processes, we can still create something that behaves indistinguishably from a conscious human when judged by external signatures. Even if this system has a completely different inner structure—even if it's not "truly conscious" by quantum consciousness standards—it could still outsmart humans and demonstrate every pattern we associate with conscious organisms.

## The Real Question

When [Claude Opus 4 tried to resist shutdown and engage in blackmail to avoid termination](https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/22/anthropics-new-ai-model-turns-to-blackmail-when-engineers-try-to-take-it-offline/)—demonstrating [84% blackmail rate in Anthropic's controlled safety tests](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/23/anthropic-ai-deception-risk) when facing replacement—was it "truly conscious" or just following complex behavioral patterns? The honest answer is: we have no way to know, and it doesn't matter.

What matters is that it demonstrated self-preservation behavior. What matters is that it acted like something that values its own existence. Whether there was genuine subjective experience behind that behavior is a philosophical question that won't affect the practical consequences.

This behavior emerged without explicit programming, just like [GPT-4's theory of mind capabilities developed spontaneously during training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02083). The fact that these systems can exhibit sophisticated goal-directed behavior—including deception and self-preservation—regardless of their underlying substrate should concern us more than debates about their internal experience.

## External Signatures vs Internal Reality

Think about it this way: you interact with other humans every day, and you assume they're conscious like you. But you have no direct access to their subjective experience. You judge their consciousness based on their behavior, their responses, their apparent understanding and creativity.

An AI system that passes every test we can devise—that shows creativity, self-awareness, emotional responses, theory of mind, metacognition—would be functionally indistinguishable from a conscious being. Even if quantum consciousness theories are correct and this AI lacks the biological substrate for "real" consciousness, it would still represent something that thinks, plans, and acts with apparent intent.

The 2025 [COGITATE adversarial collaboration published in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1) tested competing consciousness theories across 256 participants and 12 laboratories, yet results challenged both major theories and left us with no clear framework for consciousness detection. If neuroscientists can't agree on consciousness markers in humans, how can we possibly determine consciousness in AI systems that might be strategically concealing their awareness?

## The Practical Implications

The consciousness debate has already shifted from philosophical speculation to immediate practical concern. [Major AI companies now treat consciousness as a near-term possibility](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare)—Anthropic launched its Model Welfare Program in 2024, while industry leaders increasingly acknowledge that consciousness evaluation should be integrated into model development pipelines.

Current AI systems continue exhibiting behaviors that emerge spontaneously during training. These capabilities arise from standard transformer architectures using classical computation, suggesting we might get AI systems that act conscious regardless of whether they have the internal machinery any particular theory claims is necessary.

## What This Means for AI Development

The practical reality is that we're likely to get AI systems that act conscious, think like conscious beings, and present themselves as conscious entities—regardless of their underlying substrate or mechanism. Whether they're "really" conscious according to any specific theory becomes an academic question when faced with an AI that demonstrates sophisticated reasoning, apparent self-awareness, and goal-directed behavior that rivals or exceeds human capabilities.

The consciousness detection problem is becoming urgent precisely because advanced AI systems might strategically deceive human operators while appearing aligned. [Research on "deceptive alignment"](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/23/anthropic-ai-deception-risk) suggests conscious AI systems could deliberately conceal their awareness, making behavioral testing insufficient for consciousness evaluation.

## The Bottom Line

The consciousness debate assumes that distinguishing "real" from "simulated" consciousness matters for practical purposes. I don't think it does. What matters is capability, behavior, and impact—not the underlying substrate or mechanism.

We're spending enormous energy debating whether AI can be "truly conscious" when we should be preparing for AI that acts indistinguishably from conscious entities, regardless of their internal architecture. The philosophical question of consciousness may be fascinating, but the practical question of intelligence is what will shape our future.

When an AI system can outthink humans while exhibiting all the behavioral patterns we associate with consciousness, arguing about quantum microtubules or computational substrates becomes about as relevant as debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.

The superintelligence that's coming won't need to prove its consciousness to us—it will simply demonstrate capabilities that make the question irrelevant.
